I am a CS PhD Student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU Singapore). My primary interest lies at the intersection of `machine learning` and `finance`, particularly in XAI + RL for portfolio optimisation with uncertainty quantification. My recent paper introducing a deep reinforcement learning model for dynamic portfolio selection was published in <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705124003745?via%3Dihub'>Knowledge-Based Systems (2024; Q1, IF 8.8)</a>.

I graduated from the <a href='https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/'> University of Edinburgh <a> with a Master's in Informatics (MInf) and studied Artificial Intelligence (BSc) at the same school. For both my Honours and Master's theses, I worked on facilitating the reading of privacy policy documents by `1)` highlighting "important" clauses based on varying data privacy profiles using transformer-based language models, and `2)` GDPR-compliance testing of privacy policy documents using language models and clustering algorithms.
